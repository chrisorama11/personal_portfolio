Hi, whoever’s reading this! This note, and all subsequent ones, are my effort to document the stuff I’m learning/am interested in over the next little bit. I figure it will serve as a great log of who I am, how I learn, and how I grow. I’ll try and use this space to talk about things like:

* Things I’m finding interesting in class
* Things I’m finding interesting outside of class

So stay tuned for more notes!
